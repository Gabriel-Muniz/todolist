# To-do

To-do web app is a single page application to keep tracking of upcoming tasks

## What I Learned

- Working with modules
- Date and LocalStorage

## Observations

Many lessons can be taken from this project - Being, in my opinion, the most important ones:

- Planning before starting to code is extremely important to pave the road ahead. If possible, document everything planned to future reference. Documenting what has already been done also goes a long way!
- Visual reference helps to brighten up ideas and spark new ideas. It's not about plagiarism, but about inspiration!
- Even with planning beforehand, things can — and probably will — get out of hand. So expect to rework some things and reconsider others!
